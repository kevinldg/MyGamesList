## Setup with Docker

For running the application, you need a MongoDB database and a Client ID + Bearer token from IGDB. Take a look at the [IGDB API docs](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#account-creation) to get them.

In your MongoDB instance, you need a database called "my-games-list" and in there a collection called "users".

Via `docker run` command:

`docker run -d --name my-games-list -p 8080:8080 -e MONGODB_URI=... -e JWT_SECRET=... -e IGDB_CLIENT_ID=... -e IGDB_BEARER_TOKEN=... kevinldg/mygameslist:latest`
